Features
-------

* Works well on mobile devices, and is generally responsive.
* Posts can set embeddable content in the post masthead (header). Simply add a
  custom field to any post with the key "embed" and the url of an embeddable
  page as the value. Note that this only works with sites that Wordpress
  [currently supports](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds).
